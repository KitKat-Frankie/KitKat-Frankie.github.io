Hi! Iâ€™m **Frank Ago Lamptey** â€” part tech enthusiast, part creative dreamer, and full-time learner. I like to think of myself as someone whoâ€™s constantly blending the logical world of cybersecurity with the imaginative universe of storytelling and 3D animation.

## Academic Background
I studied **Computer Engineering**, which gave me a solid foundation in programming, system design, and problem-solving. My curiosity has led me to explore different sides of technology â€” from building secure systems to creating digital experiences.

## Cybersecurity Interests
Iâ€™m fascinated by how things workâ€¦ and how to make them secure.  
Some areas Iâ€™m diving into:
- **Web and Android penetration testing**
- **Networking**
- **Cloud infrastructure security**

For me, cybersecurity isnâ€™t just about defense â€” itâ€™s about understanding systems at their core and staying one step ahead.

>## One of my long-term goals is to work as a **Site Reliability Security Engineer (SRE)** â€” combining my interest in security, reliability, automation, and system performance.

## 3D Animation Journey
Now hereâ€™s where my geek side meets my creative side.  
Iâ€™m a huge fan of **Kingdom**, **Naruto Shippuden**, and **Fairy Tail** â€” and theyâ€™ve fueled my love for animation. Theyâ€™re part of why I enjoy learning **Blender** and **Unreal Engine**: because I want to bring my own characters and worlds to life in the same way those stories inspired me.  

Also, Iâ€™m **Marvel Studios biased** â€” so donâ€™t even try to convert me. You can enjoy your DC movies in peace, but Iâ€™m sticking with the MCU.

## Hobbies & Interests
- Playing **video games** ðŸŽ®  
- Reading ðŸ“š  
- Watching anime and movies ðŸŽŒ  
- Playing and following **soccer** âš½ â€” my heart belongs to **Manchester United**, no matter how many times they stress me out.

## Fun Facts
Growing up, I was glued to books like:
- *The Adventures of Tintin*
- *The Secret Seven*
- *Heroes of Olympus* series
- *Percy Jackson* series

These stories shaped my imagination, problem-solving, and curiosity. Theyâ€™re a big reason I love creating my own worlds in animation today.

## People Who Inspire Me in Tech
- **John Hammond** â€” for his practical, hands-on cybersecurity insights.  
- **Mark Zuckerberg** â€” for building something that changed how the entire world connects.  
- **Bad Decision Studios** â€” for proving that small, passionate teams can make incredible things.

## Final Note
Whether Iâ€™m building secure systems, animating a scene, reading a book, or yelling at my favorite team from my couch â€” Iâ€™m always chasing that mix of curiosity, creativity, and challenge.
