# About Me

Hi! I’m **Frank Ago Lamptey** — part tech enthusiast, part creative dreamer, and full-time learner. I like to think of myself as someone who’s constantly blending the logical world of cybersecurity with the imaginative universe of storytelling and 3D animation.

## Academic Background
I studied **Education and French**, which taught me how to communicate well, think critically, and appreciate different cultures. While my degree focused on languages, I found myself irresistibly drawn toward technology and the challenges it presents — especially in **cybersecurity**.

## Cybersecurity Interests
I’m fascinated by how things work… and how to make them secure.  
Some areas I’m diving into:
- **Web and Android penetration testing**
- **Low-level programming** and **system architecture**
- **Embedded systems security**

For me, cybersecurity isn’t just about defense — it’s about understanding systems at their core and staying one step ahead.

## 3D Animation Journey
Now here’s where my geek side meets my creative side.  
I’m a huge fan of **Kingdom**, **Naruto Shippuden**, and **Fairy Tail** — and they’ve fueled my love for animation. They’re part of why I enjoy learning **Blender** and **Unreal Engine**: because I want to bring my own characters and worlds to life in the same way those stories inspired me.  

Also, I’m **Marvel Studios biased** — so don’t even try to convert me. You can enjoy your DC movies in peace, but I’m sticking with the MCU.

## Hobbies & Interests
- Playing **video games** (because every cybersecurity guy needs his downtime)
- Reading (more on that in a moment)
- Watching anime and movies
- Playing and following **soccer** — my heart belongs to **Manchester United**, no matter how many times they stress me out.

## Fun Facts
Growing up, I was glued to books like:
- *The Adventures of Tintin*
- *The Secret Seven*
- *Heroes of Olympus* series
- *Percy Jackson* series

These stories shaped my imagination, problem-solving, and curiosity. They’re a big reason I love creating my own worlds in animation today.

## People Who Inspire Me in Tech
- **John Hammond** — for his practical, hands-on cybersecurity insights.  
- **Mark Zuckerberg** — for building something that changed how the entire world connects.  
- **Bad Decision Studios** — for proving that small, passionate teams can make incredible things.

## Final Note
Whether I’m building secure systems, animating a scene, reading a book, or yelling at my favorite team from my couch — I’m always chasing that mix of curiosity, creativity, and challenge.  

Oh, and I’ll be adding a picture of myself here soon — so you can put a face to the name.
